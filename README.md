# decky-romm-sync

A [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz/) plugin that syncs your [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) game library to Steam as non-steam shortcuts. Games appear directly in your Steam library and launch through [RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net/).

## Features

- **Library sync** — Fetches platforms and ROMs from your RomM server, creates Steam shortcuts with artwork
- **Per-platform control** — Enable/disable which platforms to sync
- **ROM downloads** — Download ROMs on demand with progress tracking and queue management
- **BIOS management** — Download firmware/BIOS files from RomM for systems that need them (PSX, Dreamcast, PS2, etc.)
- **Game detail page** — Shows install status, BIOS status, download/uninstall actions directly on each game's Steam page
- **Controller friendly** — Full gamepad navigation throughout the plugin UI
- **Steam Input config** — Per-shortcut Steam Input mode (Default / Force On / Force Off)
- **RetroArch diagnostics** — Detects misconfigured input drivers that break menu navigation

## Requirements

- [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz/) installed on your Steam Deck or Linux HTPC
- A running [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) server with ROM files

## Acknowledgments

This plugin stands on the shoulders of some great projects:

- [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz/) — the plugin framework that makes all of this possible
- [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/) — for the Steam Deck, SteamOS, and an open enough platform to build on
- [Unifideck](https://github.com/ma3ke/unifideck) — inspiration for game detail page injection techniques and gamepad navigation patterns
- [MetaDeck](https://github.com/EmuDeck/MetaDeck) — inspiration for store patching patterns used in metadata display on non-Steam shortcuts
