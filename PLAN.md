# romm-library — Decky Loader Plugin Implementation Plan

## Context

Self-hosted RomM server manages a ROM collection on Unraid. Goal: browse and play the entire RomM library directly from Steam Gaming Mode on a Bazzite HTPC, with on-demand downloads and correct RetroDECK emulator launches. No existing tool does this — DeckRomMSync is alpha/full-sync-only, Playnite RomM plugin is Windows-only.

**Core concept**: ALL RomM games appear as Non-Steam shortcuts in the Steam Library. The Decky QAM panel is only for settings, sync, and download management. This follows the Unifideck pattern (GPL-3.0, compatible with our GPL-3.0 license).

## Key Decisions

- **Play on undownloaded game**: Launcher triggers background download via plugin backend, exits cleanly. User gets toast notification. Play again when done.
- **Emulator**: RetroDECK (`flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck [-e emulator] [-s system] <rom>`). Supports per-system and per-game emulator override.
- **Shortcut creation**: Use `SteamClient.Apps.AddShortcut()` from the frontend (NOT direct VDF writes). Steam does not watch shortcuts.vdf — direct VDF edits require a restart. The SteamClient API creates shortcuts instantly in Steam's live state.
- **Frontend**: `@decky/ui` + `@decky/api` (NOT deprecated `decky-frontend-lib`)
- **Backend comms**: `callable()` from `@decky/api` (NOT `ServerAPI.callPluginMethod()`)
- **RomM Auth**: HTTP Basic Auth (OAuth2 Bearer as future option)
- **Download endpoint**: `GET /api/roms/{id}/content/{file_name}` — returns single file or ZIP for multi-file ROMs (includes M3U if applicable). Always download all files (no partial downloads).
- **RomM API quirks**: ROM filtering uses `platform_ids` (plural). Cover image URLs contain unencoded spaces (must URL-encode). Paginated responses use `{"items": [...], "total": N}` envelope.

## Environment & Git Setup

We are inside a **Distrobox container `dev`** (Fedora 43) on a Bazzite HTPC. The home directory is shared between host and container.

**SSH for git push**: The SSH agent runs on the host. Claude Code must set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` for every git push/pull:
```bash
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-XXXXXX7kJjym/agent.61196 git push
```
The socket path may change between sessions. If push fails with "Permission denied (publickey)", **ask Daniel to re-run `ssh-add`** in his terminal and provide the new socket path.

**When to ask Daniel (human) for help:**
- SSH agent expired or socket path changed → ask to `ssh-add` again
- `sudo dnf install` needed for new system packages → ask to run in terminal
- Testing in Gaming Mode → ask to switch to Gaming Mode and check
- RomM server credentials or URL → ask for connection details
- Any destructive action on Steam shortcuts or ROM files → confirm first

## Architecture

```
RomM Server ←HTTP→ Python Backend (main.py)
                        ↓ callable()
              Frontend (TypeScript) ←→ SteamClient.Apps API
                        ↓
                   Steam Library (shortcuts appear instantly)
                        ↓
                   bin/romm-launcher (bash)
                        ↓
                   RetroDECK (flatpak)
```

**Shortcut creation flow**: Python backend fetches ROM data from RomM → passes to frontend via callable() → frontend calls `SteamClient.Apps.AddShortcut()` → shortcut appears in Steam instantly. Python backend still handles: RomM API calls, ROM downloads, artwork downloads, state persistence, file I/O.

Every shortcut: `exe` → `bin/romm-launcher`, `LaunchOptions` → `romm:{rom_id}`. Launcher checks install status, either launches RetroDECK or requests download.

## RomM API Reference (key endpoints)

| Endpoint | Method | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/api/heartbeat` | GET | Health check (no auth needed) |
| `/api/platforms` | GET | All platforms (plain list) |
| `/api/roms?platform_ids={id}&limit=50&offset=N` | GET | ROMs by platform (paginated envelope) |
| `/api/roms/{id}` | GET | Full ROM detail (includes `files`, `user_saves`, `user_states`, metadata) |
| `/api/roms/{id}/content/{file_name}` | GET | Download ROM (single file or ZIP for multi-file, includes M3U) |
| `/api/romsfiles/{file_id}/content/{file_name}` | GET | Download individual file from multi-file ROM |
| `/api/saves` | GET/POST | List/upload saves. Filter by `rom_id`, `platform_id`. Upload via multipart form (`saveFile`) |
| `/api/saves/{id}` | GET/PUT | Get/update specific save |
| `/api/saves/{id}/content` | GET | Download save file binary |
| `/api/saves/delete` | POST | Batch delete saves `{"saves": [id, ...]}` |
| `/api/states` | GET/POST | Same as saves but for emulator save states |
| `/api/states/{id}/content` | GET | Download state file binary |

## SteamClient.Apps API Reference (for shortcut management)

Available from the Decky frontend JS context. Shortcuts appear instantly without restart.

| Method | Signature | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `AddShortcut` | `(appName, exe, startDir, launchOptions) → Promise<number>` | Creates shortcut, returns app ID |
| `RemoveShortcut` | `(appId) → void` | Removes shortcut instantly |
| `SetShortcutName` | `(appId, name) → void` | Sets display name |
| `SetShortcutExe` | `(appId, path) → void` | Sets executable |
| `SetShortcutStartDir` | `(appId, dir) → void` | Sets working directory |
| `SetShortcutLaunchOptions` | `(appId, options) → void` | Sets launch options |
| `SetCustomArtworkForApp` | `(appId, artworkPath, artworkType) → void` | Sets grid/hero/logo artwork |

## RetroDECK Integration Reference

**CLI**: `flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck [-e emulator] [-s system] [-m] <game_path>`

**Emulator resolution order** (when no `-e` flag):
1. Per-game `<altemulator>` in `gamelist.xml`
2. Per-system `<alternativeEmulator>` in `gamelist.xml`
3. First `<command>` in `es_systems.xml` (the default)

**Systems with multiple emulators** (examples):
- PSX: SwanStation (default), Beetle PSX, Beetle PSX HW, PCSX ReARMed, DuckStation
- PS2: PCSX2 Standalone (default), LRPS2, PCSX2 RetroArch core
- Dreamcast: Flycast RetroArch (default)
- All disc-based systems support `.m3u` extension

**Save file locations** (RetroDECK):
- RetroArch saves: `~/retrodeck/saves/{system}/`
- RetroArch states: `~/retrodeck/states/{system}/`
- Standalone emulator saves vary by emulator

## Phase 1: Plugin Skeleton + Settings ✅ DONE

**Goal**: Plugin loads in Decky, QAM shows settings, can connect to RomM.

- Plugin manifest, build config, TypeScript frontend, Python backend
- Settings persistence, connection test, platform mapping (149 entries)
- Merged to main as v0.1.0

## Phase 2: Sync + Steam Shortcuts ✅ DONE

**Goal**: All RomM games appear in Steam Library with artwork and collections.

### Completed:
- SteamClient.Apps API migration (instant shortcuts, no Steam restart)
- sync_apply event flow: backend emits shortcut data → frontend creates via SteamClient → reports app_ids back
- Artwork download with URL-encoding fix for RomM's unencoded spaces
- Artwork staging pattern (romm_{rom_id}_cover.png → {app_id}p.png) survives remove+re-add
- Per-item artwork via `get_artwork_base64(rom_id)` callable (avoids bulk base64 WebSocket crash)
- Post-AddShortcut delay increased to 500ms for reliable artwork application
- Paginated ROM fetching with `platform_ids` parameter (fixed from `platform_id`)
- Per-platform sync toggle with enable/disable all
- Drill-down QAM navigation (Main → Connection / Platforms / Danger Zone)
- Per-platform removal in Danger Zone
- Library stats computed live from registry
- Sync progress spinner: stays visible during frontend processing, auto-clears after 8s
- State persistence (shortcut_registry, sync_stats)
- Collections via correct `collectionStore` API: `NewUnsavedCollection()` + `AsDragDropCollection().AddApps()` + `Save()`
- Collections use `appStore.GetAppOverviewByAppID()` for proper app overview objects
- 45 unit tests

### Remaining — Danger Zone: Remove All Non-Steam Games:

**Problem**: Leftover non-steam shortcuts from previous imports (not managed by our plugin) clutter the library. Current Danger Zone only removes RomM-managed shortcuts.

**Feature: "Remove All Non-Steam Games" button** in Danger Zone:
- Enumerates ALL non-steam shortcuts via `collectionStore.deckDesktopApps.apps`
- Confirmation dialog (must confirm twice for safety)
- **Whitelist/Exclude list**: Button that opens a dropdown/checklist of all current non-steam games. User checks items that should NOT be removed (e.g. RetroDECK, other manually added shortcuts). Whitelist persisted in plugin settings.
- Removal calls `SteamClient.Apps.RemoveShortcut()` for each non-whitelisted shortcut

### QAM UI structure (current):
- **Main Page**: Connection status, last sync stats, Sync button + progress, nav buttons
- **Connection Settings**: URL, username, password, save, test
- **Platforms**: Enable/disable toggles per platform with ROM counts
- **Danger Zone**: Per-platform removal + Remove All RomM + Remove All Non-Steam (with whitelist)

## Phase 3: Download Manager + Multi-Disc

**Goal**: Download ROMs on-demand with full multi-disc support. Storage space validation.

### Pre-download storage check:
- Check available disk space on target filesystem before starting download
- Block download with clear error if insufficient space (ROM size + buffer)
- Show file size in download confirmation

### Single-file ROM downloads:
- `start_download(rom_id)` → async download task
- Stream from `/api/roms/{id}/content/{file_name}` to `~/retrodeck/roms/{system}/{file_name}`
- Progress tracking, cancellation, partial file cleanup
- Register in `installed_roms` state on completion
- `emit("download_complete")` for toast notification

### Multi-file / multi-disc ROM handling:

**Detection**: Check `has_multiple_files` flag from ROM API. Inspect `files` array to distinguish:
- **Multi-disc** (PS1, PS2, Saturn): Files named `(Disc 1)`, `(Disc 2)`, etc. + M3U file
- **Multi-track single disc** (audio CDs): Files named `(Track 01)`, etc. + single CUE. Not multi-disc — launch via CUE.
- **Game + DLC/updates** (Switch): Base game + update NSP files. Always download ALL files.
- **Extracted directories** (Wii U, PS3): Hundreds of files. Download ZIP, extract to ROM dir.

**Download flow for multi-file ROMs**:
1. `GET /api/roms/{id}/content/{name}` returns a ZIP containing all files + M3U (if applicable)
2. Extract ZIP to `~/retrodeck/roms/{system}/{rom_name}/`
3. Detect launch file:
   - If `.m3u` exists → store as launch path (for multi-disc)
   - Else if `.cue` exists → store as launch path (for single disc with tracks)
   - Else → first/largest file
4. Store launch file path in `installed_roms` state

**M3U auto-generation setting**: If ROM has multiple disc files but no M3U included from RomM, optionally auto-generate one (toggle in settings, default: on).

### Download request from launcher:
- `_poll_download_requests()` — async loop checking `download_requests.json` every 2s
- Launcher writes request, plugin picks it up and starts download
- Toast notification when download completes

### Frontend — QAM additions:

**Download Queue sub-page** (new nav button on Main Page):
- Active downloads with progress bars, cancel buttons
- Completed/failed downloads list

**Downloads Settings sub-page** (new nav button on Main Page):
- Download location override (default: `~/retrodeck/roms/{system}/`)
- M3U auto-generation toggle

**Game detail page injection** (route patch):
- `routerHook.addPatch("/library/app/:appid", ...)` using findInReactTree
- Show: "Not installed" + Download / Progress + Cancel / "Installed" + Uninstall
- `getRomBySteamAppId(appId)` to identify RomM games

### M3U testing checklist:
- [ ] Download a multi-disc PS1 ROM (e.g. FF7) from RomM via the API
- [ ] Verify ZIP contains M3U file
- [ ] Verify M3U content lists all disc .cue files correctly
- [ ] Extract and launch via RetroDECK with the M3U
- [ ] Verify disc swapping works in-game
- [ ] Test a multi-track single-disc ROM (e.g. Tomb Raider) — should NOT use M3U
- [ ] Test auto-generation of M3U when RomM doesn't include one

### Danger Zone — Uninstall All Installed ROMs:

**Feature: "Uninstall All Installed ROMs" button** in Danger Zone:
- Removes all downloaded ROM files from `~/retrodeck/roms/{system}/` for installed ROMs tracked in `installed_roms` state
- Confirmation dialog warns: "This will delete all downloaded ROM files. If save sync is available, sync saves to RomM first."
- If Phase 5 (save sync) is implemented, prompt to sync saves before uninstalling
- If Phase 5 is not yet implemented, show warning: "Save files may be lost — back up manually if needed"
- Clears `installed_roms` state after deletion
- Does NOT remove shortcuts — only the ROM files on disk

### Verification:
- [ ] Storage space check prevents download when disk full
- [ ] Single-file ROM download works end-to-end
- [ ] Multi-disc ROM (e.g. FF7) downloads as ZIP, extracts, has working M3U
- [ ] Launcher detects M3U and passes it to RetroDECK
- [ ] Download progress visible in QAM and game detail page
- [ ] Cancel cleans up partial files
- [ ] Game detail page shows correct install status
- [ ] Uninstall all removes ROM files and clears installed state

## Phase 3.5: Pre-Alpha Bug Fixes

**Goal**: Fix blockers preventing a usable alpha release.

### Bug 1: Controller/gamepad can't navigate game detail page — FIXED
- Download/Uninstall buttons on game detail page were plain HTML, not focusable by Steam's gamepad navigation
- **Fix**: Replaced with `Focusable` + `DialogButton` from `@decky/ui`

### Bug 2: Game launch fails silently — FIXED
Two root causes:
- **Wrong state path**: Launcher looked in `homebrew/settings/` but `state.json` lives in `homebrew/data/`. Fixed search candidates.
- **Invalid `-s` flag**: RetroDECK doesn't have a `-s system` flag — auto-detects from `roms/{system}/` directory path. Removed the flag.

### Bug 3: Steam Input conflicts with RetroArch controller — FIXED
**Symptom**: Gamepad works in-game (GBA tested) but RetroArch menu/hotkeys don't function correctly.

**Research findings (deep dive)**:
- `UseSteamControllerConfig` has three values: `"0"` (Force Off), `"1"` (Default), `"2"` (Force On)
- Our initial fix used `"0"` (Force Off) which **caused** the problem — disabling Steam Input entirely breaks controller passthrough on SteamOS/Bazzite
- EmuDeck uses `"1"` (Default) with custom controller templates, NOT Force Off
- RetroDECK **requires** Steam Input to be enabled — its hotkeys (L3+R3 for menu, save states, etc.) depend on it
- Force Off passes raw HID device; RetroArch's menu/hotkey layer doesn't see it properly
- Force On (`"2"`) normalizes the controller as standard XInput gamepad, which is what RetroArch autoconfig expects

**Fix**: Replaced boolean "Disable Steam Input" toggle with three-option dropdown:
- **Default** (`"1"` / remove key) — recommended, uses global Steam settings
- **Force On** (`"2"`) — explicitly enables Steam Input wrapping
- **Force Off** (`"0"`) — raw passthrough, only for advanced users
- "Apply to All Shortcuts" button for immediate application
- Old `disable_steam_input` boolean auto-migrates to `steam_input_mode`

### Bug 4: BIOS files required for disc-based systems — IMPLEMENTED
**Symptom**: PSX Tomb Raider fails to launch — SwanStation core requires BIOS files (e.g. `scph5501.bin`) which are missing from `~/retrodeck/bios/`.

**Research findings**:
- RomM has a full `/api/firmware` endpoint (list, download, filter by platform_id)
- BIOS files downloaded to `~/retrodeck/bios/` with platform-specific subfolders (dc → `dc/`, ps2 → `pcsx2/bios/`, everything else flat)
- MD5 verification against RomM's stored hashes
- No renaming needed — trust filenames as stored in RomM
- BIOS file management (correct naming, checksums) is RomM's or igir's responsibility

**Implementation**:
- Backend: `get_firmware_status()`, `download_firmware(id)`, `download_all_firmware(platform_slug)` callables
- Frontend: BiosManager QAM page showing per-platform firmware status with "Download All" buttons
- Path mapping via `BIOS_DEST_MAP` dict (currently hardcoded to RetroDECK paths — will become configurable in Phase 4)

### Bug 5: BIOS not shown on game detail page — FIXED
- `checkPlatformBios("psx")` failed because RomM stores firmware under `bios/ps` (slug `ps`) but platform slug is `psx`
- **Fix**: Added `_platform_to_firmware_slugs()` mapping so `psx` matches both `["psx", "ps"]`
- Game detail page now always shows BIOS status (green when ready, orange when missing)
- Clickable BIOS status opens modal overlay listing individual BIOS files per platform

### Bug 6: BIOS file lists not collapsible — FIXED
- BiosManager showed all files expanded by default, making long lists hard to navigate
- **Fix**: Added per-platform expand/collapse toggle, collapsed by default

### Bug 7: RetroArch menu not navigable with controller — FIXED
- D-pad/buttons didn't work in RetroArch Quick Menu (L3+R3), only mouse worked
- All three `UseSteamControllerConfig` values (0/1/2) tested — none fixed it
- **Root cause**: `input_driver = "x"` in RetroArch config uses X11 input on a Wayland system; menu navigation relies on `input_driver` while gameplay uses `input_joypad_driver`
- **Fix**: Changed `input_driver` to `"sdl2"` in RetroArch config
- Added diagnostic check in plugin settings: detects `input_driver` value from RetroArch config (checks RetroDECK, RetroArch Flatpak, and native paths) and shows status/warning in Controller section

### Verification:
- [x] Game detail page buttons navigable with controller
- [x] GBA game launches successfully via RetroDECK
- [x] Steam Input dropdown shows three options (Default, Force On, Force Off)
- [x] "Apply to All Shortcuts" writes correct values to VDF
- [x] Controller works in RetroArch menu with input_driver = "sdl2"
- [x] PSX game launches after BIOS download
- [x] BIOS download from RomM works
- [x] BIOS status shown on game detail page with file list overlay
- [x] BIOS file lists collapsed by default in BiosManager
- [x] RetroArch input_driver diagnostic shown in settings

---

## Phase 4: Artwork, Metadata & Native Steam Integration

**Goal**: Make ROM shortcuts look like first-class Steam games. Full artwork (hero, logo, wide grid), native metadata (description, genres, developer, release date) via store patching, and on-demand metadata caching.

### 4A: Full Artwork (all 4 types)

Currently we only set **portrait grid (assetType 0)** — the cover image in collection/grid views. Three artwork slots are empty, leaving the detail page bare.

**Steam artwork types** (all set via `SteamClient.Apps.SetCustomArtworkForApp(appId, base64, "png", assetType)`):

| Type | assetType | Dimensions | Purpose | Source |
|------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|
| Portrait Grid | 0 | 600x900 | Library grid tiles, collections | RomM cover (already done) |
| Hero Banner | 1 | 1920x620 | Detail page background | SteamGridDB |
| Logo | 2 | varies (transparent PNG) | Title overlay on hero | SteamGridDB |
| Wide Grid | 3 | 460x215 / 920x430 | Recent games shelf, list view | SteamGridDB |

**Icon (assetType 4)** cannot be set via `SetCustomArtworkForApp()` — requires `shortcuts.vdf` write + Steam restart. Deferred.

**SteamGridDB integration**:
- RomM already stores `igdb_id` and `sgdb_id` per ROM — exact match via `GET /games/igdb/{igdb_id}`, no fuzzy name search needed
- API is free, no paid tiers. Needs API key (user provides their own or we use a project key)
- Endpoints: `/heroes/game/{sgdb_id}`, `/logos/game/{sgdb_id}`, `/grids/game/{sgdb_id}?dimensions=460x215,920x430`
- API key stored in `settings.json`

**Implementation**:
- Backend: New callable `get_steamgriddb_artwork(rom_id, asset_type)` — fetches from SteamGridDB, caches to disk
- Backend: During sync, for each ROM: look up SGDB game ID via `igdb_id`, fetch hero + logo + wide grid
- Frontend: After `AddShortcut()`, call `SetCustomArtworkForApp()` for all 4 types (0=RomM cover, 1/2/3=SteamGridDB)
- After setting logo (type 2), save default logo position to prevent blank logos:
  ```typescript
  await window.appDetailsStore.SaveCustomLogoPosition(appOverview, {
    pinnedPosition: 'BottomLeft', nWidthPct: 50, nHeightPct: 50
  });
  ```
- Artwork cached on disk to avoid re-fetching on re-sync. Cache dir: `~/homebrew/data/decky-romm-sync/artwork/`
- Graceful fallback: if SteamGridDB has no match, skip that artwork type (Steam shows defaults)

**Artwork fetch timing**: During sync alongside the existing cover art download. SteamGridDB lookups add latency but artwork is cached after first sync. For 20k+ games, this may be slow — consider a "skip SteamGridDB" toggle or fetch lazily on first detail page visit.

### 4B: Native Metadata via Store Patching

No `SteamClient.Apps` APIs exist for setting description, genres, etc. on non-Steam shortcuts. However, **MetaDeck** (EmuDeck) proves that patching Steam's internal store objects works reliably and makes shortcuts look native.

**Store patches** (applied on plugin load for all registered shortcut app IDs):

| Field | Patch Target | Data Shape | RomM Source |
|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Description | `appDetailsStore.GetDescriptions()` | `{ strFullDescription, strSnippet }` | `summary` |
| Developer | `appDetailsStore.GetAssociations()` | `{ rgDevelopers: [{strName, strURL}] }` | `companies` |
| Publisher | `appDetailsStore.GetAssociations()` | `{ rgPublishers: [{strName, strURL}] }` | `companies` |
| Genres | `appStore.BHasStoreCategory()` + `m_setStoreCategories` | Steam StoreCategory enum values | `genres` |
| Release Date | `appStore.GetCanonicalReleaseDate()` | Unix timestamp | `first_release_date` |
| Controller Support | `appOverview.controller_support` | `2` (full) | Hardcode |
| Hide "non-Steam" label | `BIsModOrShortcut()` | Return `false` for our app IDs | — |

**Reference implementation**: [MetaDeck](https://github.com/EmuDeck/MetaDeck) — uses `afterPatch` from `@decky/ui`.

**Metadata fetching strategy — on-demand + cache**:
- Do NOT fetch metadata for all ROMs during sync (too slow for large libraries)
- Fetch full metadata from RomM API when game detail page is opened: `get_rom_metadata(rom_id)` callable
- Cache response in `metadata_cache.json` (separate from `state.json` to avoid bloat)
- Cache TTL: 7 days, re-fetch if expired and network available
- If offline and cached: show cached data. If offline and not cached: show "metadata unavailable"
- Store patches read from cache — if metadata not yet cached for an app ID, patches return empty/default (Steam shows nothing, same as now)

**Backend changes**:
- New callable `get_rom_metadata(rom_id)` — fetches from RomM API `GET /api/roms/{id}`, extracts and returns structured metadata
- Metadata cache: `metadata_cache.json` keyed by `rom_id`, stores `{ summary, genres, companies, first_release_date, screenshots, cached_at }`
- Handle ROMs without IGDB match gracefully (return empty metadata)

**Frontend changes**:
- On plugin load: apply store patches for all registered app IDs
- Patches check `metadata_cache.json` (loaded into memory) for the requested app ID
- When `GameDetailPanel` mounts: call `get_rom_metadata(rom_id)`, update cache, re-apply patches for that app ID
- Loading state while metadata fetches (detail page briefly shows defaults, then fills in)

### 4C: Screenshots — DEFERRED to Phase 8

Steam's screenshot viewer is for user-captured screenshots. Injecting IGDB promotional screenshots there would be misleading. The only option is a custom gallery in GameDetailPanel — cosmetic, low priority.

### Verification:
- [ ] Detail page shows hero banner background image
- [ ] Detail page shows logo overlay on hero
- [ ] Wide grid image appears in recent games shelf and list view
- [ ] Portrait grid still works (regression check)
- [ ] Games without SteamGridDB match degrade gracefully (no hero/logo, just defaults)
- [ ] Description shows in native Steam detail page area
- [ ] Genres displayed natively
- [ ] Developer/publisher displayed natively
- [ ] Release date displayed natively
- [ ] Controller support shows "Full Controller Support"
- [ ] Metadata loads on first detail page visit, cached for subsequent visits
- [ ] Cached metadata shown when offline
- [ ] ROMs without IGDB metadata show graceful fallback
- [ ] SteamGridDB API key configurable in settings
- [ ] Store patches survive QAM close/reopen and Steam sleep/wake

---

## Phase 4.5: Pre-Phase-5 Bug Fixes

**Goal**: Fix bugs found during alpha testing before moving to save sync.

### Bug 1: ROM download button does nothing on Steam Deck — FIXED
**Symptom**: Clicking the Download button on the game detail page does nothing on Steam Deck. No error, no progress, just nothing happens. BIOS downloads work fine on the same device. Works correctly on Bazzite HTPC.

**Root cause**: Investigated and resolved — download handler was not properly triggering on Steam Deck due to event propagation differences.

### Bug 2: DangerZone counts not refreshing after removal — FIXED
**Symptom**: After removing shortcuts via DangerZone (per-platform or remove-all), the game counts displayed next to each platform did not update. User had to close and reopen the QAM to see correct counts.

**Root cause**: The `showModal()` confirmation dialog caused the QAM panel to remount when dismissed, creating a race condition where the component re-rendered with stale data before the removal operation completed and state refreshed.

**Fix**: Replaced `showModal()` confirmation dialogs with inline confirmation UI (confirm/cancel buttons rendered directly in the DangerZone component). This avoids the QAM remount race entirely. Also added cross-refresh calls so that after any removal operation (per-platform, remove-all-romm, remove-all-non-steam), the component re-fetches counts for all affected sections.

### Bug 3: Non-Steam shortcuts appear on other devices via Steam Remote Play — DOCUMENTED
**Symptom**: Non-Steam shortcuts created by the plugin on one machine (e.g. Steam Deck) appear on other machines logged into the same Steam account (e.g. Bazzite HTPC). Shortcuts show without artwork, and disappear when the source machine goes offline.

**Root cause — Steam Remote Play discovery protocol (NOT Steam Cloud)**:
This is NOT `shortcuts.vdf` syncing via Steam Cloud. `shortcuts.vdf` is local-only and never leaves the machine. What users see is Steam's **In-Home Streaming / Remote Play discovery protocol**:

1. **Discovery**: Steam clients on the same LAN broadcast UDP packets on port 27036. When two clients with the same Steam account discover each other, they establish a TCP control connection.
2. **App advertisement**: The source client sends `CMsgRemoteClientAppStatus` protobuf messages containing `ShortcutInfo` for each non-Steam shortcut. This includes: `name`, `icon`, `categories` (collections), `exepath`, and `launch_options`.
3. **What's NOT transmitted**: Artwork files (grid, hero, logo) are local filesystem references — they don't transfer over the protocol. This is why remote shortcuts appear without artwork.
4. **Ephemeral**: These phantom shortcuts exist only while the TCP connection is live. When the source machine goes offline (sleep, shutdown, network disconnect), the shortcuts disappear from the remote client.
5. **No per-shortcut opt-out**: Steam advertises ALL non-Steam shortcuts to remote clients. There is no API or setting to exclude specific shortcuts from streaming advertisement.

**Detection APIs available**:
- `collectionStore.localGamesCollection` — contains only locally-created shortcuts (excludes remote phantoms)
- `SteamAppOverview.per_client_data` — array of `{ clientid, client_name, ... }` entries; remote shortcuts have entries from a different client
- `SteamAppOverview.local_per_client_data` — only the local machine's entry

**Implementation — DangerZone protection + device labels**:
- **DangerZone**: Filter removal operations to only include locally-owned shortcuts (using `localGamesCollection` or `per_client_data` checks) to prevent accidentally removing remote phantom entries
- **Game detail panel**: Show device availability labels (e.g. "Available on: Steam Deck") when `per_client_data` indicates the shortcut originates from another device

**Known Steam bugs**:
- Steam issue #8791: Name collisions when identical shortcut names exist on source and remote client
- Steam issue #12315: "Stream" button regression — sometimes remote shortcuts only show "Stream" instead of allowing local launch

**References**: See wiki page "Steam Remote Play and Cross-Device Shortcuts" for full protocol documentation.

### Verification:
- [x] ROM download works on Steam Deck from game detail page
- [x] Download progress visible after clicking download
- [x] Error shown if download fails
- [x] DangerZone counts refresh immediately after removal operations
- [x] DangerZone confirmation uses inline UI (no modal remount race)
- [x] Non-Steam shortcut cross-device behavior documented (Steam Remote Play, not Cloud)
- [x] DangerZone protected from removing remote streaming phantom shortcuts
- [ ] Device availability labels shown in game detail panel

## Phase 4.5: Codebase Restructuring

**Goal**: Split oversized files into focused modules before adding more features. Currently `main.py` is 1800+ lines and `tests/test_main.py` is 2400+ lines — both will keep growing with save sync (Phase 5) and metadata (Phase 4B).

**Backend (`main.py` → `backend/` package)**:
- `backend/__init__.py` — Plugin class, lifecycle (_main, _unload), settings
- `backend/romm_api.py` — RomM HTTP client (connection, auth, requests)
- `backend/sgdb.py` — SteamGridDB integration (artwork fetch, verify key, cache)
- `backend/sync.py` — Sync engine (_do_sync, report_sync_results, registry)
- `backend/downloads.py` — ROM download manager (start, cancel, progress, multi-file)
- `backend/firmware.py` — BIOS/firmware management
- `backend/state.py` — State persistence (state.json, settings.json, save/load)

**Tests (`tests/test_main.py` → split by module)**:
- `tests/test_sgdb.py` — SGDB artwork and verify tests
- `tests/test_sync.py` — Sync engine tests
- `tests/test_downloads.py` — Download manager tests
- `tests/test_firmware.py` — BIOS tests
- `tests/test_settings.py` — Settings/state tests
- `tests/conftest.py` — Shared fixtures (already exists)

**Considerations**:
- Decky Loader expects a single `main.py` entry point with a `Plugin` class — the Plugin class stays in `main.py` but delegates to modules
- Need to verify Decky's Python environment supports relative imports from subdirectories
- All 140+ tests must pass after restructuring (no behavior changes)

## Phase 5: Save File Sync (RetroArch .srm saves) — IN PROGRESS

**Goal**: Bidirectional save file synchronization between RetroDECK and RomM for RetroArch-based systems. Covers per-game `.srm` saves only — standalone emulator saves (PCSX2, DuckStation, Dolphin, etc.) deferred to Phase 7.

**IMPORTANT: RomM account requirement**: Save games in RomM are tied to the authenticated user account. Users MUST use their own RomM account (not a shared/generic one) so saves are correctly attributed. Document this in README and show a warning in settings if the account appears to be shared (e.g. username is "admin" or "romm").

### Scope — RetroArch per-game .srm saves only:

Systems covered (all use RetroArch cores via RetroDECK):
- NES, SNES, GB, GBC, GBA, Genesis/Mega Drive, Master System
- N64, PSX (via SwanStation/Beetle PSX cores), Saturn, Dreamcast
- PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, Neo Geo Pocket, WonderSwan, Atari Lynx
- Any other system using a RetroArch core with `.srm` save files

Save path pattern: `~/retrodeck/saves/{system}/{rom_name}.srm`

**Explicitly deferred** (see Phase 7):
- PS2 via PCSX2 (shared memory cards)
- PSX via DuckStation standalone (`.mcd` files)
- GameCube/Wii via Dolphin (`.gci` files, region subfolders)
- PSP via PPSSPP (title ID directories)
- NDS via melonDS (`.sav` files)
- 3DS via Azahar, Wii U via Cemu (NAND/title ID structures)

### Device registration:

The plugin registers with RomM's `/api/saves` as a device so saves are attributed to this machine. A `device_id` (UUID) is generated on first use and persisted in `save_sync_state.json`. This allows multi-device save management — each device's saves are tracked independently.

### Session detection:

Uses `SteamClient.GameSessions.RegisterForAppLifetimeNotifications` to detect game start/stop events. `Router.MainRunningApp` provides reliable app ID resolution after a short delay (500ms). Suspend/resume hooks (`RegisterForOnSuspendRequest` / `RegisterForOnResumeFromSuspend`) pause playtime tracking during device sleep.

The frontend `sessionManager.ts` maintains a cached `appId -> romId` map (from backend registry) to quickly determine if a launched app is a RomM shortcut.

### Three-way conflict detection:

Conflict detection uses three data points:
1. **Local file**: current `.srm` on disk (hash + mtime)
2. **Last-sync snapshot**: hash of the file at last successful sync (stored in `save_sync_state.json`)
3. **Server save**: RomM's version (hash + `updated_at` timestamp)

This is more reliable than simple two-way timestamp comparison because it can distinguish:
- Local-only changes (local differs from snapshot, server matches snapshot)
- Server-only changes (server differs from snapshot, local matches snapshot)
- True conflicts (both local and server differ from snapshot)
- No changes (all three match)

### Conflict resolution modes (user setting):
- **"Newest wins"** (default): Compare local mtime vs server `updated_at`, use whichever is more recent
- **"Always upload"**: Local saves always win, upload even if server is newer
- **"Always download"**: Server saves always win, overwrite local
- **"Ask me"**: Queue the conflict and show it in the Save Sync settings page for manual resolution (keep local / keep server)

Clock skew tolerance is configurable (`clock_skew_tolerance_sec`, default 5s) to handle minor time differences between devices.

### Sync flows:

**Pre-launch sync** (if `sync_before_launch` enabled, default: on):
1. Game start detected via lifetime notification
2. Backend fetches server saves for this ROM via `GET /api/saves?rom_id={id}`
3. Three-way comparison against local file and last-sync snapshot
4. If server has newer save and no conflict → download and replace local
5. If conflict → resolve per conflict mode (or queue for "ask me")
6. Non-blocking: game launch is not delayed by sync failures

**Post-exit sync** (if `sync_after_exit` enabled, default: on):
1. Game stop detected via lifetime notification
2. Backend scans local save file, computes hash
3. If local hash differs from last-sync snapshot → save has changed
4. Three-way comparison with server version
5. If no conflict → upload via `POST /api/saves` with `rom_id` and `emulator`
6. If conflict → resolve per conflict mode or queue
7. Toast notification on success or conflict

**Manual sync all**:
- "Sync All Saves Now" button in Save Sync settings
- Iterates all installed ROMs, performs three-way check for each
- Reports total synced count and any conflicts found

**Offline queue drain**:
- If server is unreachable during post-exit sync, changes are queued locally
- Queued changes are retried on next successful server contact

### Playtime tracking:

**Local tracking**: Session start/end times recorded via `recordSessionStart` / `recordSessionEnd` backend callables. Suspend/resume pauses are subtracted for accurate delta. Playtime delta stored per-ROM in `save_sync_state.json`.

**Steam display**: Steam tracks playtime natively for non-Steam shortcuts — no additional work needed for the Steam UI.

**RomM `last_played`**: After each session, the backend updates the ROM's `last_played` timestamp on the server. Ready for future RomM playtime API when it becomes available.

### State schema — save_sync_state.json:

Separate file from `state.json` to avoid bloating the main state. Structure:

```json
{
  "device_id": "uuid-v4",
  "saves": {
    "<rom_id>": {
      "last_synced_at": "ISO-8601",
      "last_snapshot_hash": "md5-hex",
      "server_save_id": 123,
      "playtime_seconds": 3600
    }
  },
  "pending_conflicts": [
    {
      "rom_id": 42,
      "file_path": "saves/gba/game.srm",
      "local_hash": "abc...",
      "local_mtime": "ISO-8601",
      "server_hash": "def...",
      "server_updated_at": "ISO-8601",
      "server_save_id": 456,
      "detected_at": "ISO-8601"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "conflict_mode": "newest_wins",
    "sync_before_launch": true,
    "sync_after_exit": true,
    "clock_skew_tolerance_sec": 5
  }
}
```

### QAM UI:

**Save Sync settings sub-page** (`SaveSyncSettings.tsx`):
- Auto-sync toggles: sync before launch, sync after exit
- Conflict resolution mode dropdown (newest_wins, always_upload, always_download, ask_me)
- "Sync All Saves Now" button with status feedback
- Pending conflicts section: shows unresolved conflicts with "Keep Local" / "Keep Server" buttons

**Game detail page**: Save status (last synced, local/remote status) visible per-game. Manual sync button per-game.

### Remaining work (Phase 5 completion):

#### 1. Backend retry logic with exponential backoff
`lib/save_sync.py` currently has no retry on failed uploads/downloads — a single failure goes straight to the offline queue. Add retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 3s, 9s) before falling back to the offline queue. This applies to:
- `_romm_upload_save()` — retry the multipart POST
- `_romm_download_save()` — retry the GET
- `_romm_list_saves()` — retry the list call
- Any RomM API call in `pre_launch_sync` and `post_exit_sync`

The offline queue drain (`sync_all_saves`, next `pre_launch_sync`) should also use retry logic when processing queued entries.

#### 2. Pre-launch sync toast notifications
`sessionManager.ts` only shows toasts for post-exit sync (success/failure/conflicts). Pre-launch sync (lines 70-80) silently logs to console. Add toasts:
- Success: "Saves downloaded from RomM" (only if files were actually downloaded, not on no-op)
- Failure: "Failed to sync saves — playing with local saves"
- Conflict in "ask me" mode: "Save conflict detected — resolve in Save Sync settings"

**Blocking behavior on conflict**: If a save conflict is detected during pre-launch sync, **block the game launch** and show a popup/modal asking the user to resolve immediately. This mirrors Steam Cloud's native behavior. Options in the popup:
- "Use Local Save" — upload local, then launch
- "Use Server Save" — download server save, then launch
- "Launch Anyway" — skip sync, launch with whatever is on disk
- "Cancel" — abort launch entirely

This only applies to "ask_me" conflict mode. Other modes (newest_wins, always_upload, always_download) auto-resolve and launch without interruption. If the server is unreachable, show a brief toast ("RomM unreachable — playing with local saves") and launch without blocking. On the next launch where the server IS reachable, if there are unresolved conflicts from previous offline sessions, show the conflict resolution popup before launching.

#### 3. Conflict resolution popup with file details
The current SaveSyncSettings page shows basic "Keep Local" / "Keep Server" buttons for pending conflicts. Improve this with a detailed popup/modal when the user clicks to resolve a conflict. The popup should show:
- File name and system (e.g. "Pokemon FireRed.srm — GBA")
- Local file: size, last modified timestamp, which device
- Server file: size, `updated_at` timestamp, which device last uploaded
- Options: "Keep Local" (upload ours), "Keep Server" (download theirs), "Keep Both" (upload ours as new slot, download theirs alongside), "Skip" (defer)

This gives users enough information to make an informed choice, especially in multi-device scenarios where they may have played on different machines.

#### 4. Retry UI for failed sync operations
When a save sync fails (after all backend retries exhausted), the user should have a way to retry:
- Show a toast with the failure message. If the Decky toast API supports action buttons, add a "Retry" action.
- In SaveSyncSettings, show failed/queued operations with a "Retry Now" button per entry.
- In the game detail panel, if a save sync failed for that ROM, show a "Sync Failed — Retry" indicator.

The offline queue already persists failed operations — this is about surfacing them to the user and letting them trigger manual retries.

#### 5. Playtime storage via RomM user notes
RomM has no dedicated playtime field (feature request #1225 open). As a workaround, store playtime in the per-ROM user notes field available via the RomM API. Each ROM's `RomUser` model has a `note_raw_markdown` (or similar) field accessible through `PUT /api/roms/{id}`.

**Format**: Append a machine-parseable tag to the notes without disturbing user-written content:
```
<!-- romm-sync:playtime {"seconds": 18450, "updated": "2026-02-17T10:30:00Z", "device": "steamdeck"} -->
```

**Flow**:
1. After each play session (in `record_session_end`), fetch the ROM's current notes from RomM
2. Parse our playtime tag if present, or start from 0
3. Add the session delta to the stored total
4. Update the tag in the notes and PUT back to RomM
5. On other devices, read the notes to get cross-device playtime totals

**Edge cases**:
- **User edits the tag manually with a valid value** (e.g. corrects playtime to a different number): Accept it. On next session end, fetch the server value, treat it as the new baseline, and add the session delta to it. If the user-edited value is higher than our local total, update our local total to match (user may have played on another platform we don't track). If the user-edited value is lower than our local total, ask the user which to keep — "Server says 3h, local says 5h — keep local or server?" — since the user may have intentionally reset their playtime.
- **User deletes the tag entirely**: Treat as "no server playtime". Upload local playtime total on next session end, re-creating the tag.
- **User wants to set playtime manually**: The game detail panel or save sync settings should allow the user to manually enter a playtime value (hours/minutes input). This overwrites both the local total and the RomM notes tag. Use case: user played on a different platform before using the plugin and wants to set their accumulated playtime, or wants to correct a wrong value.
- **Multiple devices update simultaneously**: Last write wins. Acceptable for playtime — small deltas mean the worst case is losing one session's worth of time, which is recovered on the next session from that device.
- **Notes field empty or missing**: Create with just our tag.
- **Migration**: When RomM adds a real playtime API, stop writing to notes and read from the new field instead. Optionally offer a one-time migration to copy the notes-based playtime into the new field.

**Research needed**: Confirm the exact API endpoint and field name for per-user ROM notes. Check if it's `PUT /api/roms/{id}` with a `note_raw_markdown` body field, or a separate user endpoint.

#### 6. RomM shared account warning
PLAN.md specifies: "Users MUST use their own RomM account (not a shared/generic one) so saves are correctly attributed." Add a warning in ConnectionSettings when the username looks like a shared account:
- Check if username is "admin", "romm", "user", "guest", or similar generic names
- Show an orange warning below the username field: "Save sync requires a personal account. Shared accounts (like 'admin') will mix save files between users."
- Non-blocking — the user can still proceed, it's just informational

### Verification:
- [ ] Save file uploaded to RomM after play session ends
- [ ] Save file downloaded from RomM before game launch
- [ ] Three-way conflict correctly identified (both sides changed)
- [ ] "Newest wins" resolves based on timestamp comparison

## Phase 6: Bug Fixes & Stability

**Goal**: Fix known bugs and improve reliability before adding more features.

### Bug 1: Sync Progress Bar Not Updating

**Symptom**: Progress bar appears briefly (indeterminate), then either freezes or disappears. Does not show real-time progress during sync. The sync itself completes successfully — only the UI feedback is broken.

**What was tried (all failed)**:
1. Setting initial `syncProgress` immediately in `handleSync()` before `await startSync()`
2. Changing backend `finally` block to not emit `running: false` prematurely (added 60s safety timeout)
3. Adding `updateApplyProgress` callable for frontend to report per-item progress back to backend
4. **Event-based approach**: Backend emits `sync_progress` events via `decky.emit()`, persistent listener in `index.tsx` writes to module-level store, MainPage polls store at 250ms — no WebSocket round-trips

**Current architecture** (as implemented but not working):
- `syncProgress.ts`: Module-level variable store (`_progress`), updated by event listener + syncManager
- `index.tsx`: Persistent `sync_progress` event listener calls `setSyncProgress()` on the module store
- `syncManager.ts`: Calls `updateSyncProgress()` per shortcut during the applying phase
- `MainPage.tsx`: `setInterval(250ms)` reads `getSyncProgress()` from module store, updates React state

**Research findings**:
- QAM panel **unmounts** `MainPage` when closed, destroying all React state and intervals. On reopen, MainPage remounts fresh — this is handled by checking the store on mount.
- Decky's WebSocket bridge has contention: concurrent `callable()` calls (e.g. `getArtworkBase64()` during sync) may block or delay other calls.
- The module-level store approach should bypass WebSocket contention since it's a plain JS read, but progress still doesn't update.

**Investigation needed**:
- Verify `sync_progress` events are actually being received by the frontend (add `console.log` in event listener)
- Verify the `setInterval` in MainPage is actually running and reading updated values
- Check if `setSyncProgress` in the event listener is being called with correct data
- Check if `updateSyncProgress` in syncManager is being called (the applying phase runs entirely in frontend)
- Consider whether the 250ms polling interval is too slow or if React batching is preventing re-renders
- Test with a minimal reproduction: hardcode progress updates on a timer to isolate whether the issue is data flow or rendering

### Bug 2: Cancel Sync Not Working

**Symptom**: Clicking "Cancel Sync" does not stop the frontend shortcut processing loop. Backend cancellation may work (stops ROM fetching), but the frontend `sync_apply` handler continues processing all shortcuts.

**Current implementation**:
- `syncManager.ts`: Module-level `_cancelRequested` flag, checked after each shortcut in the loop
- `MainPage.tsx`: `handleCancel()` calls both `requestSyncCancel()` (sets frontend flag) and `cancelSync()` (backend callable)
- Backend `cancelSync()`: Sets `_sync_cancel = True` in Python, which stops the backend sync loop

**Why it might not work**:
- The `sync_apply` event is fired ONCE with all shortcut data. By the time the user clicks cancel, the backend has already emitted the full payload. Backend cancellation only helps if the backend is still fetching ROMs.
- The frontend cancel flag (`_cancelRequested`) should work for the frontend loop, but may not be checked if the loop is blocked on an `await` (e.g. `addShortcut()` or `getArtworkBase64()`)
- Need to verify `requestSyncCancel()` is actually being called and the flag is being read

**Investigation needed**:
- Add `console.log` to verify `requestSyncCancel()` is called
- Add `console.log` inside the sync loop to verify the flag check runs
- Check if the `await getArtworkBase64()` call is blocking for a long time, preventing the cancel check
- Consider adding the cancel check BEFORE the artwork fetch (currently only checked at end of loop iteration)
- Consider whether a different cancellation mechanism is needed (e.g. AbortController for fetch calls)

### Bug 3: RomM M3U Lists BIN Files Instead of CUE

**Symptom**: RomM's download endpoint auto-generates M3U files for multi-file ROMs. For single-disc multi-track games (e.g. Tomb Raider), the M3U lists all `.bin` tracks + the `.cue` file. This is wrong — the M3U should only list `.cue` files (for multi-disc switching). The CUE file already references its BIN tracks internally.

**Impact**: Our `_detect_launch_file` prefers M3U over CUE. So RetroArch gets an M3U pointing to raw BIN files instead of the proper CUE sheet. Audio tracks won't play correctly.

**Fix**: After extraction, validate downloaded M3U files. If an M3U contains only `.bin` entries (plus optionally one `.cue`), it's a bad single-disc M3U — delete it. A proper multi-disc M3U lists `.cue`/`.chd`/`.iso` entries. Alternatively, fix `_detect_launch_file` to prefer CUE over M3U when the M3U only contains `.bin` files.

### Bug 4: State Consistency / Startup Pruning

**Problem**: `state.json` can drift from reality after crashes or force-closes:
- `installed_roms` entry exists but the ROM file is gone from disk
- `shortcut_registry` entry exists but the Steam shortcut no longer exists
- ROM file exists on disk but no `installed_roms` entry tracks it (orphaned partial download)
- Single-file downloads lack `.tmp` atomicity

**Solution — startup state healing in `_main()`**:
1. **Prune `installed_roms`**: Iterate entries, remove any where `file_path` no longer exists on disk.
2. **Prune `shortcut_registry`**: Frontend checks which Steam shortcuts still exist via `SteamClient` API, reports stale app IDs back to backend. Backend removes orphaned registry entries.
3. **Download atomicity**: Single-file ROM downloads should write to `{file_path}.tmp` and `os.replace()` to final path on completion.
4. **Save state after pruning**: Write the cleaned state back to `state.json` before normal operation begins.

### Bug 5: SSL Certificate Verification for External HTTPS APIs

**Symptom**: SGDB API calls fail with certificate errors on Steam Deck. The `ssl.create_default_context()` can't find CA certs in the embedded Python environment.

**Current workaround**: RomM API calls (local LAN) use `ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE` which is acceptable for a self-hosted server on a trusted network. SGDB calls currently also use `CERT_NONE` as a temporary fix.

**Proper fix needed**: For public internet APIs (SteamGridDB, IGDB), we should use proper certificate verification. Options:
- Bundle `certifi` package and set `ctx.load_verify_locations(cafile=certifi.where())`
- Point to the system CA bundle if available (`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`)
- Use `requests` library instead of `urllib` (handles certs automatically)

This is a security concern — `CERT_NONE` on public APIs allows MITM attacks. Low risk for this use case (API keys, not credentials) but should be fixed before any production release.

### Bug 6: Secrets Stored in Plain Text

**Symptom**: `settings.json` stores `romm_pass` and `steamgriddb_api_key` in plain text. Any process or user with read access to `~/homebrew/settings/decky-romm-sync/settings.json` can read credentials.

**Current state**: Decky Loader doesn't provide a secrets/keyring API. All Decky plugins store settings as plain JSON.

**Investigation needed**:
- Check if other Decky plugins (MoonDeck, etc.) encrypt credentials
- Check if Python's `keyring` module is available in Decky's embedded Python
- Consider using OS keyring (libsecret/GNOME Keyring) if available on SteamOS/Bazzite
- Minimum fix: restrict file permissions to owner-only (`chmod 600`)
- Ensure debug logging never exposes these values (mask in logs)

### Bug 7: BIOS Status Reporting Needs Rethinking

**Current behavior**: We compare how many BIOS files exist on RomM for a platform vs how many are downloaded locally. If the counts don't match, we show "missing". The game detail page shows an orange badge with "BIOS required — X/Y downloaded".

**Problems**:
- Not all BIOS files listed in RomM may actually be required for a given game/emulator — some are regional variants, optional files, or for specific emulator backends
- Showing "missing" when optional BIOS files aren't downloaded creates false urgency
- No distinction between "required and missing" vs "optional and missing"
- Need to investigate: does RomM provide any metadata about which BIOS files are required vs optional? Does RetroDECK/RetroArch have a way to check which BIOS a specific core needs?

**Investigation needed**:
- Check what BIOS metadata RomM's firmware API returns (required flag? per-core association?)
- Check if RetroArch/RetroDECK has a BIOS requirements file per core
- Consider showing "X required / Y optional" instead of just "X/Y downloaded"
- Consider only warning when actually required BIOS files are missing

### Verification:
- [ ] Progress bar shows real-time progress during sync
- [ ] Cancel button stops the sync mid-progress
- [ ] Single-disc multi-track game launches via CUE, not bad M3U
- [ ] Startup pruning removes orphaned state entries
- [ ] Partial downloads cleaned up on startup

---

## Phase 7: Multi-Emulator Support (Deferred)

**Goal**: Support EmuDeck, standalone RetroArch, and manual emulator installs beyond RetroDECK. Also extends save sync to standalone emulators.

### Emulator platform presets:
- **RetroDECK** (current): `~/retrodeck/roms/`, `~/retrodeck/bios/`, `~/retrodeck/saves/`
- **EmuDeck**: `~/Emulation/roms/`, `~/Emulation/bios/`, `~/Emulation/saves/`
- **Manual**: All paths user-configurable

### Configurable paths:
- ROM directory, BIOS directory, save directory, emulator launch command
- All stored in `settings.json`
- Update `BIOS_DEST_MAP`, `start_download()`, and launcher to read from settings

### Enhanced launcher:
- Per-preset launch commands
- EmuDeck per-system emulator mapping
- Verify emulator installed before launch

### Per-system emulator/core selection:
- New "Emulators" QAM sub-page
- Per-game override on detail page
- Resolution order: per-game → per-system → preset default

### Standalone emulator save sync:

Phase 5 covers RetroArch `.srm` saves only. This phase adds support for standalone emulator save formats, which use fundamentally different save file structures.

**PS2 via PCSX2**:
- Shared memory card files: `Mcd001.ps2`, `Mcd002.ps2`
- Path: `~/retrodeck/saves/ps2/` or PCSX2 `memcards/` directory
- Challenge: entire memory card must be synced (contains saves for multiple games)
- Tracking: system-level rather than per-game; upload/download the whole card

**PSX via DuckStation**:
- Memory card format: `.mcd` files in `duckstation/memcards/`
- Per-game or shared cards depending on DuckStation config
- Same shared-card challenge as PCSX2

**GameCube via Dolphin**:
- Per-game `.gci` save files in region-specific subfolders
- Path: `dolphin-emu/GC/{region}/Card A/` (USA, EUR, JAP)
- Region detection needed to find the right subfolder

**PSP via PPSSPP**:
- Save directories named by title ID (e.g. `ULUS10041/`)
- Path: `PPSSPP/PSP/SAVEDATA/{title_id}/`
- Title ID mapping required: ROM filename -> title ID for save discovery

**NDS via melonDS**:
- Per-game `.sav` files (same name as ROM)
- Path: `~/retrodeck/saves/nds/` or melonDS save directory
- Straightforward per-game sync, similar to RetroArch `.srm`

**3DS via Azahar**:
- NAND/SDMC structure: saves stored by title ID
- Complex directory hierarchy under `azahar/sdmc/` and `azahar/nand/`
- Title ID mapping required

**Wii U via Cemu**:
- mlc01 directory with title ID structure
- Path: `cemu/mlc01/usr/save/{title_id_high}/{title_id_low}/`
- Title ID mapping required

**Shared challenges**:
- Title ID mapping: need a database or API to map ROM filenames to emulator-specific title IDs
- Shared memory cards: must sync at system level, not per-game; conflicts affect all games on the card
- Multiple save slots: some emulators support multiple save slots per game

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Advanced Features (Deferred)

**Goal**: Production-ready with good UX and reliability.

- **Multi-version/language ROM selector**: Dropdown when multiple versions exist in RomM
- **Auto sync interval**: Configurable background re-sync
- **Library management**: Detect removed/updated ROMs on RomM, stale state cleanup
- **Offline mode**: Cache lists locally, queue operations
- **Stacked sync progress UI**: Replace single progress bar with phased checklist
- **Error handling**: Retry with backoff, toast notifications, detailed logging
- **Connection settings: remove save button, save on popup confirm**: Each connection field (URL, username, password) already has an edit button that opens a popup. Change behavior so that confirming the popup immediately persists the new value to settings. Cancelling the popup must discard any changes and restore the original value. Remove the global "Save" button entirely — it is no longer needed since each field saves independently on popup confirmation.
- **RomM playtime API integration**: When RomM adds a playtime field (feature request #1225), plug in our existing delta-based accumulation to sync playtime bidirectionally. Architecture is already in place — just needs the API endpoint.

---

## Future Improvements (nice-to-have)

- **Concurrent download queue**: Support multiple queued downloads instead of one at a time.
- **RomM native device sync**: When RomM v4.7+ ships device sync features, migrate from our own conflict resolution.
- **Download queue priority/reordering**: Let users reorder queued downloads.
- **Developer vs Publisher distinction**: RomM's `companies` is a flat list with no role info. Research IGDB's `involved_companies` relationship (has `developer` and `publisher` boolean flags) to properly split companies. May need an extra API call to IGDB or a RomM enhancement.
- **BIsModOrShortcut bypass counter**: MetaDeck uses a counter system to let `BIsModOrShortcut` return `true` for specific internal Steam calls (GetGameID, GetPrimaryAppID, GetPerClientData, BHasRecentlyLaunched) while returning `false` for UI rendering. Our simple "always false for our apps" approach works for now since ROM shortcuts are cleanly in the non-Steam ID range. Implement if users report: broken play time tracking, missing from Recently Played, or console errors about app ID lookups. ~80 lines, small-medium effort.
- **RetroAchievements integration**: Show and track RetroAchievements for games. RomM supports adding RA data. Research needed: fetch from RomM's RA data vs. query RetroAchievements API directly vs. leverage an existing Decky plugin (e.g. there may be a dedicated RA Decky plugin). Display options: badge on game detail page, achievement list overlay, progress tracking.
- **Sync completion notification accuracy**: The post-sync toast always reports "Added X games" using the total count of shortcuts processed. This is misleading — re-syncing an unchanged library shows the same count as a fresh sync. Fix: track which shortcuts are truly new (didn't exist before) vs. updated (already existed, metadata/artwork refreshed) vs. unchanged (skipped entirely). Display an accurate breakdown like "Added 3 new, updated 12, 485 unchanged" or just "Library up to date" when nothing changed. Requires comparing incoming ROM data against `shortcut_registry` before processing and counting each outcome category in `syncManager.ts`.
- **Playtime sync between RomM and Steam**: Sync playtime data bidirectionally between Steam's per-shortcut playtime and RomM's per-ROM playtime tracking. Challenges: merging playtime across multiple devices (additive — sum deltas, not overwrite), deciding sync direction (Steam → RomM after play sessions, RomM → Steam on sync for display), and displaying it in Steam's native playtime field (research if `SteamClient.Apps` or store patching can set the played-time value). Could also surface RomM's cross-device total playtime in the game detail panel.
- **UI settings page**: Add a settings sub-page for UI display preferences. Toggleable options with sensible defaults:
  - **Machine-scoped collections** (default: on): Append hostname to collection names, e.g. "RomM: N64 (steamdeck)". When off, use plain "RomM: N64".
  - **Device availability labels** (default: on): Show "Also on [device]" / "Streamable from [device]" in game detail panel. When off, hide device info.
  - **Custom device display name**: Override the hostname shown in collections and labels (e.g. "Deck" instead of "steamdeck-12345").
  - Future UI toggles (metadata display, artwork preferences, etc.) would live here too.
